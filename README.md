# wordchars

Makes Minecraft's word detection work a bit more like `bash`'s. That is to say...

Usually, when holding `CMD` or `ALT` and pressing `←` or `→`, the cursor moves to the next space between words in the appropriate direction. (the literal "space" character)

This mod makes it so that it moves to the next space, OR any of `*?_-.[]~=/&;!#$%^(){}<>`, just like most Linux terminals do.
